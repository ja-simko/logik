### Welcome to the game of Logik, also known as Mastermind.

Mastermind is a challenging puzzle game that originally involved two players.
One player is a codemaker and the other is a codebreaker.
It so happens that the codemaker is idle most of the time, so I created a digital, 1-player version.
The game is played entirely in the terminal, and you are given options to modify the rules of the game.
Happy playing!
